# Broken Access Control

Even while access control looks like a simple problem, it is really difficult to manage efficiently. The access control model of the web application is closely tied to the content and functionality that a website provides. The users may also be a part of a range of jobs or groups with different capabilities.

Developers frequently underrate how difficult it is to implement a reliable access control mechanism. Many of these strategies were not actively made; rather, they are the outcome of how the website has evolved through time. In these circumstances, many places in the code introduce access control restrictions. As the site is put into use, the ad hoc collection of rules becomes progressively more challenging to comprehend.

Many of these problematic access control techniques are easily accessible and exploitable. Frequently, all that is required is a request for features or content that shouldn't be permitted. Once a flaw is discovered, an inadequate access control system might have severe results. In addition to accessing unauthorized material, an attacker may be able to change or remove content, perform unauthorized actions, or even take over site administration.

For our web app, in a scenario where an attacker exploits the broken access control vulnerability related to the "Editor's Choice" functionality, the attacker begins by researching the target e-commerce web application. They become aware of the exclusive "Editor's Choice" label on certain products, indicating that these products have been reviewed and recommended by the company's editorial team. Curious about the process and eager to exploit potential vulnerabilities, the attacker uses an API buster tool to brute force all the API endpoints associated with the web application. After some time, the tool discovers the hidden API endpoint responsible for marking products as "Editor's Choice." With unauthorized access to this endpoint, the attacker proceeds to mark various products, potentially their own or those from compromised seller accounts, as "Editor's Choice." This manipulation can have severe consequences, as customers may be misled into purchasing subpar or even malicious products based on the fraudulent endorsements. Moreover, the attacker's unauthorized access to the "Editor's Choice" functionality can lead to a tarnished brand reputation, loss of customer trust, and potential legal liabilities for the e-commerce platform.
